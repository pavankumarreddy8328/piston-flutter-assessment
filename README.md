# 📄 ZephyrPay Performance and Debugging Assessment

## 📝 Project Overview

Welcome to the **ZephyrPay** assessment project. You have been provided with a partial Flutter app that simulates a fintech application. The app fetches transaction data from a mock API, caches it for offline use, and displays it in a simple list view.

### Main Features:

- Display a list of financial transactions.
- Pull-to-refresh to update the transaction list.
- Offline caching of transaction data.
- Simple navigation to transaction details.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites:

- Flutter SDK (latest stable version)
- Android Studio / VS Code (recommended)
- Android or iOS emulator (or a physical device)

### Installation:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd zephyrpay
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

4. Run the app:

   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

## 🎯 Assessment Objectives

Your primary goal is to **improve the performance, stability, and code architecture** of the app. You will find that the current implementation has several flaws that need addressing.

### Focus Areas:

1. **Performance Optimization:**

   - Improve the scrolling performance of the transaction list.
   - Identify and eliminate jank during data loading.
   - Utilize background isolates for heavy data processing if necessary.
   - Profile the app before and after optimization to quantify improvements.

2. **Architecture Refinement:**

   - Refactor the code to enhance maintainability and scalability.
   - Avoid rebuilding the entire UI on minor data changes.
   - Separate business logic from UI for better state management.

3. **Stability & Robustness:**

   - Fix the data duplication issue during pull-to-refresh.
   - Implement proper error handling for API failures.
   - Ensure offline caching works without causing memory leaks.

4. **Judgment and Justification:**

   - Clearly document any architectural or design decisions you make.
   - Justify the introduction of new libraries or patterns.

---

## 🧩 What to Fix

The current implementation has known issues. Use your skills to address the following:

1. **Slow Scrolling Performance:** The transaction list becomes laggy as the number of items increases.
2. **Data Duplication:** Pull-to-refresh sometimes duplicates transaction entries.
3. **Memory Leak:** Large lists cause memory issues.
4. **Poor State Management:** The entire UI rebuilds on every data change.
5. **Error Handling:** Network errors are not handled gracefully.

---

## 🛠️ What You Are Expected to Deliver

1. **Optimized Codebase:**

   - Improve performance, architecture, and stability as described.

2. **Profiling Results:**

   - Use Flutter DevTools to compare performance before and after optimization.
   - Include screenshots or a brief summary of your profiling data.

3. **Documentation:**

   - Write a **short report (README or a separate file)** explaining:

     - Key issues identified
     - Fixes implemented
     - Performance improvements with benchmarks
     - Trade-offs and design decisions

4. **Code Quality:**

   - Follow Flutter best practices.
   - Ensure clean, maintainable, and well-documented code.
